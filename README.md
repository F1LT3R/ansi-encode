## About

This simple Node module takes a JavaScript string containing ANSI escape sequences and converts them into regular JavaScript strings. It is a bit like using `escape(string)`, where `escape()` turns individual characters into their respective codes; wheres`ansiEncode()` converts ANSI escape sequences back into plain strings.

This `ansi-encode` exists because I ran into problems creating tests color terminal output in other Node modules. When a test failed in Mocha, I was able to see the ANSI escape codes and copy the correct string into the test. When I started using [AVA - The Futuristic Test Runner](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing code, I discovered the escape sequences were not printed. This gave me no way to test color console output.
